FIX01:
# TODO: max number of metadata should be 10. Currently limited to 6.
# However, 10 exceed the eBPF limits:
# error: <unknown>:0:0: in function collector i32
# (%struct.xdp_md*): Looks like the BPF stack limit of 512 bytes
# is exceeded. Please move large on stack variables into BPF per-cpu array map.
cdef enum: __MAX_INT_HOP = 6

FIX02:
Make sure all influxdb inserts are correct. self.int_time is not necessary. Should
use the collector timestamp


FIX04:
Make VID a 12-bit field instead of 16. EVCs with Vlan PCP might become an issue.

Brainstorming:
tail-call for extra functions and extra switches?
test with netronome NICs

FIX05:
INT reports should be considered with a VLAN id. Line 218.
